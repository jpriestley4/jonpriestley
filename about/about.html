                <h1>Behind the pixels:</h1>
                <p>Hello there! My name is Jonathan Priestley, and I'm a UX designer with a passion for creating digital experiences that are not only visually stunning but also accessible and inclusive for all. </p>
                <p>As a Senior Product Specialist at Bloomberg, I had the opportunity to work directly with a diverse range of clients on a high-end digital product, helping to curate workflows that met their business needs and exceeded expectations. This experience taught me the importance of putting users first and understanding their needs, behaviors, and pain points to design products that solve real problems.</p> 
                <p>On a personal level, I have a unique perspective on accessible and inclusive design, as I am a wheelchair user myself. Through my own experiences, I've come to appreciate the value of designing products and interfaces that are not only functional and usable but also considerate of different abilities and disabilities.</p>
                <p>As a UX designer, I strive to incorporate this understanding into every project I work on. I believe that great design should be available to everyone, regardless of their abilities, and I'm committed to creating products that are intuitive, engaging, and accessible to all users.</p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring new restaurants, binge-watching my favorite TV shows, and trying to perfect my serve in wheelchair tennis.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little. Feel free to explore my work and if you have any questions then don't hesitate to get in touch. My contact details are the following:</p>
