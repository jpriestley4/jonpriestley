                    <p style="text-align: center"><em>"Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards" - Peter Lynch</em>
                    <p> In the finance industry, retail investors have been typically labelled as ‘dumb money’ because they tend to base their investment decisions on instinct rather than research and unfortunately such behaviour adversely affects their investment returns. This is largely due to retail investors not having enough time, experience, or patience to conduct thorough investment research.</p>
                    <p>Renowned money manager, Peter Lynch, argues that retail investors are able to pick winning stocks just as well as Wall Street experts by taking notice of their immediate world around them and doing just a little research into financial statements.</p>
                    <p>For many amateur retail investors, financial statement analysis has been made out to be esoteric and technical. However, once equipped with the understanding of what different key numbers mean, reviewing financial statements becomes part of a broader and more intuitive process of interpreting a story surrounding a company and deciidng on whether or not to invest. </p>
                    <p> Today, many decision support systems do little to empower amateur investors in interpreting financial information. Instead, these systems are typically designed to offload the user's cognitive processing, resulting in slow and ineffective learning. </p>
                    <div class="the-challenge">
                        <h3 style="text-align:center"> The Challenge </h3> 
                        <p> How might we design a system that empowers amateur investors to interpret a company's financial statements? </p>

                    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 5%"> Project Aim </h3> 
                    <p>The aim of this project is to research the interaction behaviour and rationale of expert financial analysts when interpreting financial statements. Subsequently, this project aims to address this behaviour in a prototype designed to support amateur investors.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align:center">Objectives</h3>
                    <p> To achieve this aim, I established the following objectives:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To understand the interaction behaviour and rationale of expert financial analysts when interpreting financial statements.</li>
                            <li>Establish design guidelines in line with the research findings.</li>
                            <li>Produce a high-fidelity prototype that supports amateur investors in interpreting financial statements.</li>
                            <li>Evaluate the usefulness of the prototype by observing amateur investors using the prototype to interpret financial statements.</li>

                            <p>I began the research process by conducting some desk research to identify appropriate methods that I can use to understand the behaviour and rationale of expert analysts when performing financial statement analysis. It was important to explore methods that emphasised a naturalistic approach whereby participants are observed in their natural environments. One method that stood out was contextual inquiry.</p>
                            <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
                            <p>I employed a contextual inquiry approach by interviewing a sample of eight expert financial analysts as they performed financial statement analysis in their natural environment. This involved participants analysing the financial statements of a company that they needed to analyse now or in the near future and then deciding on whether or not to invest in that company. </p>
                            <p> The interviews were conducted remotely via zoom. </p>

                            <li><strong>Context: </strong>Capture an ongoing experience rather than summary experience and concrete data as opposed to abstract data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partnership: </strong>Collaborate with the participant to develop a shared understanding of the participant’s work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpretation: </strong>Assign meaning to insights gathered by infering possible system designs which can support the participant’s work structure. </li>
                            <li><strong>Focus: </strong>Have a clear interview framework to steer the conversation towards data that is relevant for the study.</li>
