                    <p style="text-align: center"><em>"Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards" - Peter Lynch</em>
                    <p> In the finance industry, retail investors have been typically labelled as ‘dumb money’ because they tend to base their investment decisions on instinct rather than research. This is largely due to retail investors not having enough time, experience, or patience to conduct investment research. Unfortunately, such behaviour negatively affects investment returns.</p>
                    <p> Renowned money manager, Peter Lynch, argues that retail investors are able to pick winning stocks just as well as Wall Street experts by taking notice of their immediate world around them and doing just a little research into a company's financial statements.</p>
                    <p> For many amateur retail investors, financial statement analysis has been made out to be esoteric and technical. However, once equipped with the understanding of what different key numbers mean, reviewing financial statements becomes part of a broader and more intuitive process of interpreting a story surrounding a company. </p>
                    <p> Today, many decision support systems do little to empower amateur investors with interpreting financial information. Instead, these systems are typically designed to offload the user's cognitive processing, resulting in slow and ineffective learning. </p>

                            <p>I began the research process by conducting some desk research to identify appropriate methods that I can use to understand the behaviour and rationale of expert analysts when performing financial statement analysis. It was important to explore methods that emphasised a naturalistic approach whereby participants are observed in their natural environments. One method that stood out was contextual inquiry.</p>
                            <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
                            <p>I employed a contextual inquiry approach by interviewing a sample of eight expert financial analysts as they performed financial statement analysis in their natural environment. This involved participants analysing the financial statements of a company that they needed to analyse now or in the near future and then deciding on whether or not to invest in that company. </p>
                            <p> The interviews were conducted remotely via zoom. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Context: </strong>Capture an ongoing experience rather than summary experience and concrete data as opposed to abstract data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partnership: </strong>Collaborate with the participant to develop a shared understanding of the participant’s work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpretation: </strong>Assign meaning to insights gathered by infering possible system designs which can support the participant’s work structure. </li>
                            <li><strong>Focus: </strong>Have a clear interview framework to steer the conversation towards data that is relevant for the study.</li>

                            <p>During the conceptual design stage, my focus was on ‘getting the right design’ as opposed to ‘getting the design right’. Therefore, I started the design process by sketching low-fidelity conceptual wireframes onto a whiteboard. This quick and dirty approach helped me to think more openly and creatively about how the design guidelines can be implemented into the prototype. </p>

                            <p>With the sketches as a guide, I designed a high-fidelity clickable prototype using Figma. To showcase the full range of features and functionality that would be available in a final product, I designed the prototype to a highly detailed level. To ensure consistency in the visual design of the prototype, I created a design library in Figma which incorporated guides for colour, typography and grids along with a range of reusable functional components.</p>

                            <p>I used Disney as a use case for illustrating how the product can support amateur investors in interpreting a company’s financial statements. I chose Disney for the following reasons: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Many amateur investors will have some understanding of Disney as a business due to its significant presence in popular culture, allowing me to see how effective the prototype is supporting the user's pre-existing knowledge.</li>
                                <li>Disney has a broad and complicated business which gives amateur investors plenty of room to use the breadth of the features on the prototype to develop more nuanced and refined story of the company. </li>

                    <p>I also decided to integrate a short video into the prototype to bring awareness to the breadth of features available on the prototype. This helped to support a more naturalistic evaluation. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Expert analysts were found to conduct financial statement analysis in an intuitive manner of framing and reframing a company’s information to make an informed investment decision.</li>
                        <li>Based on these findings and the findings of related literature, I established a set of six design guidelines to inform the design of a prototype.</li>
                        <li>By showing a statistically significant increase in the confidence levels of amateur investors after using the prototype, the evaluation revealed that these guidelines are useful in supporting amateur investors with interpreting financial statements.</li>
